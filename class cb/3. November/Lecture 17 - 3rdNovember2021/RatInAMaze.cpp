/*

Given a m x n maze with some blocked cells (marked with 'X'), and rat that wants to
go from the src (0, 0) to the dst (m-1, n-1) design a recursive algorithm to
	a) check if there exists a path from src to dst
	b) print all the paths from src to dst
such at each step the rat can only move in the right or down direction.

Example 
	Input : 

		maze = {"0000",
	            "00X0",
	            "000X",
	            "0X00"}
	
	Output :

		1 (Yes, path exist from src to dst)
	
		Paths : 
			       {"1100", {"1000", {"1000",
		            "0100",	 "1100",  "1000",
		            "0110",  "0110",  "1110",
		            "0011"}  "0011"}  "0011"}
